Samuel Beckmann's Mindex 2022 Coding Challenge

This solution is done as Samuel Beckmann's submission for the Mindex 2022 Coding Challenge. For the Dev team if you are seeing this, as of 02/20. It is not finished as intended, please check back soon, as I will update this when I finish it to a better standing.
AS of 3/16/22 all I need to fix is the connection with the Post for Compensation and it is ready to submit I believe.
